# 2021-Hackathon-V2.0
This will be my own version of our mobile app entry in the official Blue Hacks 2021, organized by Compsat. 

## Orion Sentinels
Original developers of this app and the realization of our ideas include (me) and the following:
- Carcellar, Mon Timothy Isaac M.
- Espiritu, Joseph Benedict 
- Magahis, Carlos Andrei F.
- Ugale, Rionne Angelo

Original Mobile App Entry can be found [here] (https://github.com/Blue-Hacks-2021/Orion-sentinels) 

## What's New
* The original mobile app entry was written in Kotlin. In this project, I will try to recreate the app using Flutter, a Dart-based framework used to create native mobile applications as well.
* The original ideas that were supposed to be inserted in the original app will be attempted to be realized.
